# gpm_activity
Provides the user with information about their most listened to songs and artists over a specified time period on either Google Play Music or YouTube Music by parsing through the "MyActivity.json" or "watch-history.json" file, respectively (available to download from Google Takeout).

"MyActivity.json" or "watch-history.json" can be downloaded by choosing to download "My Activity" or Watch History from Google Takeout in JSON format. Only include activity data from Google Play Music or YouTube watch history (deselect all other products).

Clone the repository and put your json file in the same folder as the "googlemusicinfo.rb" or "ytmusicinfo.rb" file. 

Type ```ruby googlemusicinfo.rb``` or ```ruby ytmusicinfo.rb``` and follow the instructions.
